## Tax Brackets by Region

The UK has different tax brackets depending on which nation you live in. The calculator supports:

- **UK (England & Northern Ireland)**: Standard UK-wide rates
- **Scottish**: Scottish rates for Scottish taxpayers

### Scottish Higher Rate Gap (UK.5)

The Scottish Higher Rate threshold (£43,662 estimated for 25/26) is **~£6,600 lower** than the UK-wide threshold (£50,270), creating a significant "Scottish Tax Gap" for middle earners.

| Threshold                  | Scottish (25/26 est) | UK-wide  | Gap      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- | -------- |
